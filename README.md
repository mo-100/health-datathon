# PreSafe

Welcome! This repository contains the code, notebooks, and supporting materials for the Health Datathon project. This README is written in plain, human-friendly language to help contributors, collaborators, and reviewers get started quickly.

What this project is
- Goal: Explore real-world health data to identify patterns, build reproducible notebooks, and generate actionable insights while following privacy and ethics best practices.
- Audience: data scientists, clinicians, students, and researchers interested in healthcare analytics and reproducible workflows.

What's in this repo
- notebooks/ — Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the analysis and models used in the datathon.
- data/ (not included) — instructions and pointers for accessing the datasets used. Sensitive data is NOT committed; see Data Access below.
- src/ — helper scripts and modules used by the notebooks and experiments.
- requirements.txt — Python package requirements for reproducing the notebooks locally.
- LICENSE — license for the code (check this repo's LICENSE file for details).

Quick start (run locally)
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/mo-100/health-datathon.git
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # on macOS/Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Get the data (see Data Access section below) and place it in the data/ directory as instructed.
4. Launch Jupyter and open a notebook:
   jupyter lab  # or jupyter notebook

Data Access and privacy
- This repository does not contain sensitive patient data. If the datathon uses restricted datasets, follow the event or data provider instructions to request access.
- When you obtain datasets, do not upload them to this public repository. Keep raw data locally or in approved storage and add processing steps to notebooks or scripts.
- Remove or anonymize any personal identifiers before sharing derived data.

Notebooks and reproducibility
- Each notebook in notebooks/ should be runnable from top to bottom after installing the requirements and placing the data in data/ as specified.
- If a notebook takes a long time to run, we include a shorter demo notebook with a small sample or precomputed artifacts in notebooks/demo/.

How to contribute
- Find something you want to improve (a notebook, a bug, a documentation issue).
- Make a small, focused change on a branch and open a pull request that describes the problem and the proposed fix.
- Include tests or a short reproducible example if your change affects code.
- For major changes (new datasets, architectural changes), open an issue first to discuss the plan.

Style and tooling
- Python code: follow PEP8 and type hints where helpful.
- Notebooks: keep narrative text, clear headings, and runnable code cells.

Common commands
- Run tests: pytest
- Format code: black .

Maintainers and support
- Maintainers: mo-100
- For questions, open an issue or contact the maintainers via GitHub.

License
- See the LICENSE file in this repository for licensing details.
